# AOC 2019
I skipped some of the later int-code machine puzzles and maybe some others in later days. This will be all the int-code parts plus anything else I skipped

* Day 2: This was the first int-code machine puzzle. They started earlier than I remembered. I am doing each of these in Python and then in Rust
* Day 5: This is the next day with the int-code machine. Already I remember why I was not super happy about these. I had to rewrite a good bit to better accommodate input and output. Add to that the new instructions and it is a good bit of code to have for an early day
* Day 7: Another int-code day and we will have to rewrite how my machine handles input and output some more to be able to handle this puzzle. It will need an automated way for the input to come in and a way to take action on output. Part 1 is done, but part 2 will need changes to the int-code machine to be able to hold its state between runs if needed and, maybe, to hand back control to the caller after each output
